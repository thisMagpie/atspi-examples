This is a bunch of atspi examples that I used while working on
gnome-shell accessibility implementation:

* I needed to create terminal programs because it was complex to use
  accerciser while working on gnome-shell. For any other application,
  my recommendation is still use accerciser, as has a lot of more
  options.

* In any case, I think that it would be good to have something like
  these examples published somewhere, because right now, libatspi
  doesn't have any real examples around, except perhaps Orca, but it
  uses pyatspi2 and is too big as a first example (imho).

* They were written in C because at some periods (mostly due the
  python3 migration), it was complex to get those programs done in
  python. Was easier to write them in C that fix the python
  dependencies issues.

* There are also some scripts written in javascript, initially created
  to test the gobject-introspected bindings, after finding that those
  had some bugs not found on pyatspi2. It would be good to get the
  same functionality of the C programs.

Eventually, those examples could be part of atspi itself. But probably
it also makes sense to keep them as a different repository, so we can
have examples written in different languages (only C written examples
fit on atspi)

# Python Examples

## Running Python Examples

To run python examples simply type the following into the terminal from the source
directory:

`cd python; ./example.py`

Replacing "example.py" with the name of the example code you wish to run

## Current Examples

### print_active_window_heirarchy.py

This example listens to keypress events until it gets either an F3 or and F4
event.

##### Instructions

Press F3 to print the accessible hierarchy and F4 to exit
